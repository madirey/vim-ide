# Uhhhh......... Why???
# Are you taking your medication???

- Keeps me closer to the command-line (I have the POWER!!!)
- It's everywhere!
- It's mature!
- It's open source!
- I have a need... a need for SPEED!
- Something to be said for minimalism...
- Vim will always be there.
- Vim is a long-term investment.


# But what about PyCharm...?

- PyCharm is a great IDE
- But JetBrains == Java, and Java apps are still painfully clunky.


# Okay, but Sublime...?

- Sublime is a great editor.
- But it's not everywhere.
- And it's not as mature.
- If you really prefer a GUI, Sublime is nice.
- But... by the time you've reached for your mouse, my work is already done. ;)


# The Learning Curve... it's Too Much!!!

- Steep learning curve?  Did you invest in learning StreetFighter / Mortal Kombat combos?
- Do you get paid to play video games?
- If you do, where do I sign up?


# Okay, let's see it in action!

- You are... ;)
- But let's dig deeper...


# Tmuxinator

- Keep all projects independently organized.
- I don't have to remember anything.
- Can run Django server and grunt watch tasks, etc automagically...
- Can launch everything within virtual environment.


# Long-running Processes

- runserver
- grunt watchers


# Breakpoints

- <leader>b
- and in sitepackages, too!


# Editing Code

- Jump-to-definition <leader>j
- Code completion .<tab>
- Snippets <snippet><tab>


# TSlime

- What is TSlime?
- Why?  (Because ":!python manage.py test" sucks)
- Git commands (status, blame, commit, etc...)
- Run tests <leader>t
- Zoom tmux pane <ctrl-a>z (or <leader>+ / <leader>- from vim)


# Other fun vimmy stuff

- 'gx' to open links
- vim-surround (e.g. change surrounding -- cs<old><new>)


# So how do I learn to practice
# this arcane art?
- Ask Gandalf
- http://vimcasts.org/ !!!
- https://github.com/mattcaldwell/dotfiles
- https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim
- tons of other resources...


# Next Steps?

- Django template jump-to-definition and autcompletion.
- More tslime macros.
- Expand tslime macros across windows (tabs), rather than just panes.
